# Deterministic Validation Engine (Phase 1)

Validation pipeline:

1. Required components present
2. Word order matches frame slots
3. Subject-verb agreement
4. Logic compatibility (semantic tags)
5. Sentence completeness and normalization

Error tags:
- `subject_verb_agreement`
- `missing_component`
- `word_order`
- `logic_mismatch`

Feedback is rule-based and supportive (no AI, no shaming).
