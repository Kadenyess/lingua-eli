## 💡 Tips for Teachers

### Before Class
- ✅ Test the app on classroom devices
- ✅ Ensure Chrome browser is installed (best TTS support)
- ✅ Check internet connection
- ✅ Have backup devices ready

### During Class
- 👀 **Monitor First Students:** Watch first few students take assessment to catch issues
- 🎧 **Audio Settings:** If TTS doesn't work, check browser audio permissions
- 📱 **Device Setup:** Tablets work great, but test first
- ⏱️ **Time Management:** Assessment takes 10-15 minutes, plan accordingly

### Supporting Students

- Celebrate small progress

**For Emerging Students (Levels 11-20):**
- Use sentence frames as teaching tool
- Encourage journal writing daily
- Review vocabulary regularly

**For Expanding/Bridging Students (Levels 21-40):**
- Encourage independent work
- Use journal prompts for discussion
- Challenge with more complex vocabulary

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Audio/TTS not working
- **Solution:** Check browser audio permissions, try Chrome browser
- **Alternative:** Click sounds can be enabled in settings (top right)

**Problem:** Student progress lost
- **Solution:** Progress saves to browser localStorage. If browser data is cleared, progress is lost
- **Prevention:** Don't clear browser data during pilot

**Problem:** Assessment not showing
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache, try incognito mode
- **Check:** Look for `assessmentCompleted` in browser console

**Problem:** App looks broken
- **Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Check:** Ensure JavaScript is enabled

**Problem:** Student placed at wrong level
- **Note:** Assessment is adaptive. If student seems misplaced:
  - Check their actual performance in modules
  - Levels can be adjusted manually (requires code change)
  - Document for post-pilot review

- **Export Data:** (Future feature) Export progress data

### What to Look For
